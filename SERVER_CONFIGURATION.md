- x1.16xlarge

- 64 core

- 1T memory

- 20T SSD storage (EBS)

- 25G bandwidth

The super node will be hosted on a multi-cloud hybrid platform, which is developed in-house. It will allow us to seamlessly migrate the service to any major cloud provider and scale along with the traffic growth.

1) With the increase of node traffic, the server will face greater request pressure. At that time, we will expand the cloud server on demand to complete a higher level of load balancing. 
We will upgrade to x1.32x large/128 core CPU/2TB memory/2TB SSD/25G bandwith

2) Establish a complete node monitoring system, including:
System status monitoring: monitoring the physical status of the hardware (such as temperature, running time, etc.), load status of the node (such as CPU utilization, memory utilization, hard disk usage, network load, etc.) and network status of the node (such as establishing with other nodes TCP connection, UDP connection, etc.) and node automated test results to establish performance alerts
Node out of block monitoring: monitoring the number of blocks, block production speed, the number of transactions, the number of contracts, etc.Node event monitoring: Monitoring nodes initiate transactions or contracts, verify transactions or contracts, generate blocks, start or stop certain services, establish or disconnect connections, etc.
Log monitoring

3) Node security defense scheme: adopt intelligent DNS resolution system, set up access by region and sub-operator, set up port monitoring, perform traffic cleaning at the same time, clear garbage traffic, and retain normal access traffic to ensure node security

4) Data disaster recovery backup plan: In cooperation with domestic leading data centers, tailor disaster recovery backup solutions to ensure that nodes can still provide normal data and services to network systems in the event of natural disasters or vandalism, and to the maximum extent Continuity and data security
